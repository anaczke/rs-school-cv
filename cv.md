**ABOUT MYSELF**

Programming fascinates me because of its logic and endless possibilities. Having completed an intensive Frontend Developer course in SDA, I’m continue self-learning to improve my skills. I also studied UX/ UI research and design as I am interested in web graphics styles. Learning new things gives me great satisfaction.

In my marketing career, I have been responsible for a great number of marketing projects, including new website design, rebranding, visual identification, promotional movies, product info materials, international fairs. I have considerable experience in designing videos and static graphics for social media as I administrated company profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. With a long record of creating content for websites, marketing materials and newsletters both in Polish and English I have proved my copywriting skills.
